# Climate Change's Effect on Tree Communities

##Project Summary & Problem
As a practicing landscape architect, it’s hard to ignore the role climate change plays in the profession. The American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) released their Climate Action Plan last year, which outlines their vision for their goals by 2040, as well as the action items and initiatives it will take to get there. To supplement this document, I would like to visualize how plant material, specifically trees, will be affected by climate change and other environmental factors in the future. 

The rate at which the climate is warming means dire consequences for ecosystems and forced plant migration for the species that are able to survive. Neilson et. al. predicted the need to account for this shift as published in 2005 in their article “Forecasting Regional to Global Plant Migration in Response to Climate Change”, and yet the research since then on plant migration within the country has been sparse. This is particularly important in a profession where we are planning landscapes that must endure in an ever-changing environment. If we continue planting for the climate today, it likely will not be relevant in the coming 10-20 years.
